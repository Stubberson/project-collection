# Deep Learning
In this folder you'll find a few deep learning notebooks I've written. I self-studied the book [Deep Learning with Python (2021)](https://sourestdeeds.github.io/pdf/Deep%20Learning%20with%20Python.pdf) by Francois Chollet to understand deep learning on a practical level. In addition, I took a course called Deep Learning for Geodata at TU Berlin.

There are two notebooks that follow the book by Chollet, and a modified notebook from the univeresity course.
