### 2/3 Spotify Clips
A personal project where a friend asked me to create Spotify clips for their album songs. This is one of them. I used photogrammetry to 3D model the statue in the video and imported that model to Blender.

### 3/3 City Explorer
A school project where I got my first touches into animation and augmented reality (AR). My goal was to rethink school excursions through immersive urban learning. I used Adobe Illustrator and After Effects to create the video and Unity to explore and demonstrate the AR application.

## Posters
A few posters and collages that I've created for a variety of projects.

### 1/3 Yearbook Title Page
A title page from a faculty yearbook. For one year, I was the visual lead for the yearbook. The yearbook theme was "northern lights". Adobe Suite (InDesign, Illustrator and Photoshop) was used for the design.

### 2/3 ParticipAR
A poster for my thesis work. ParticipAR was a further development-step from the City Explorer project. It was designed to be an application for urban planners to visualize urban plans in their realistic locations with AR. At the same time, the application was used to collect feedback from citizens by asking their opinions and mapping their emotional response to the plans through a GRS device.

### 3/3 Album Cover
This was an album cover (which didn't end up to be used, but I like it) for my aforementioned friends. I used Photoshop and Illustrator for this work.
