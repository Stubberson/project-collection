Here are a few videos from personal and school projects. All animation, editing and vfx are done by me. The videos are compressed from the original quality for GitHub.
Used software:

## 2. Spotify Clips
A personal project where a friend asked me to create Spotify clips for their album songs. This is one of them. I used photogrammetry to 3D model the statue in the video and imported that model to Blender.

## 3. City Explorer
A school project where I got my first touches into animation and augmented reality (AR). My goal was to rethink school excursions through immersive urban learning. I used Adobe Illustrator and After Effects to create the video and Unity to explore and demonstrate the AR application.
