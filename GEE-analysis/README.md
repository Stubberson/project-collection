# Satellite Analysis of Gaza
This report examined the destruction of the Gaza Strip by the Israeli Defense Forces between April 2023 and April 2024.

## Methodology
I used Google Earth Engine to study the area through satellite imagery and spectral indices. More specifically, I used Sentinel-2 L2A multi-spectral imaging which offers orthorectified surface reflectance data.
* True color images were used to create a `.gif`-animation which shows two images per month for the time period between April 2023 and April 2024.
* Spectral indices (IBI and NDVI) were used to analyze the change in the landscape and especially vegetation (figures 1 and 2).

## Results
The spectral indices point to a decline in vegetation and an increase in "built-up" (non-vegetated) area on the Gaza Strip after Israeli bombing. In the gif-animation, one can spot smoke plumes in the northern part of the Strip.
