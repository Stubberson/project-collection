# Google Earth Engine
This folder is for GEE analyses done in school and as personal study. GEE "combines a multi-petabyte catalog of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets with planetary-scale analysis capabilities," (earthengine.google.com). The analyses for personal study follow the book [Cloud-Based Remote Sensing with Google Earth Engine â€“ Fundamentals and Applications](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-26588-4) by Cardille et al. (2024).
