This folder is for GEE analyses done in school and as personal study. GEE "combines a multi-petabyte catalog of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets with planetary-scale analysis capabilities,"[^1]. The analyses for personal study follow the book Cloud-Based Remote Sensing with Google Earth Engine â€“ Fundamentals and Applications by Cardille et al. (2024)[^2].
